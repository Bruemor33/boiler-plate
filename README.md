# React 16 and Webpack 4 boiler plate project

This is a boiler plate I created so that I or anyone could get a react application up and running using a few commands.

The tech stack is:
+ React
+ Redux
+ Webpack
+ Babel
+ Jasmine
+ Enzyme

## How to get the project running

1. Clone the project using ssH `git clone github:url projectName`
2. Once the project has been cloned, cd into the project directory `cd projectName/`
3. Now since you are in the project directory run `npm install` to install the dependecies located in project.json
4. Once the depencies are installed run `npm run buld` to compile a production version of the project
5. Once the build is complete you can run `npm run test` to see what the test suite is doing
6. To use the webpack-dev-server I've included in the project run `npm run watch`
